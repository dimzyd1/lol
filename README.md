LibraryClass.js
1. Library
Create a class called  BOOK  whose constructor's parameters are title, author, number of pages, and type of a book (novel, fairy tale, detective, etc.). The class also has a method print info, which prints the book's information on the screen in a readable form.
Create a class called LIBRARY, whose constructor creates an empty list of books. The class must have the following methods:
• Method add book, which takes an instance of the class Book as an argument and adds it to the list of books.
• Method print books, which prints the information of all the books in the library using the method print info.
• Method borrow_ book, whose argument is the book title as a string. The capitalization of letters in the argument may not be correct. The method searches for a book with that title in the list of books. If the book exists in the list, then removes it from the list and returns the book instance found. If the book doesn't exist, then leaves the list unchanged and returns the value None.
